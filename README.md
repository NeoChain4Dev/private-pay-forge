# 🔒 Private Pay Forge

> **The Future of Freelance Work is Here** - Where Privacy Meets Productivity

A revolutionary decentralized freelance platform that leverages **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** to create the world's first truly private gig economy. Built on cutting-edge blockchain technology, we're redefining how freelancers and clients interact in a secure, transparent, and privacy-preserving environment.
